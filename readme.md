# Reactive open forum
This project aims to modernize forum interface using Reactjs && Material Design. The idea is to simplify forum browsing experiences with accessible navigation. Besides, sometimes we don't want to view particular comments in a forum thread, this design enables us to hide particular user comments on our favour :v: .  
Ultimately, the project should support Wordpress and I believe it is the right direction. As self-taught developer, I know how hard it is to materialise some ideas for none-technical people. Hence, I think this project can provide blueprint for people to make something themselves.  
For [proof of concept](http://188.166.213.121), it is built on top of Meteorjs. The service still lacks many forum features, if you are interested, please give me a hand to make it awesome.
