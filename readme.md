# Reactive open forum
This project aims to modernize forum interface using Reactjs && Material Design. The idea is to simplify forum browsing experiences with accessible navigation. Besides, sometimes we don't want to view particular comments in a forum thread, this design enables us to hide particular user comments on our favour :v: .  
Ultimately, the project will make it easy to integrated into existing systems such as Nodejs, Rails, Django, etc...     
For proof of concept, the project is built on top of Meteorjs. We are porting to nodejs with NPM support so you can integrate into your existing project.
